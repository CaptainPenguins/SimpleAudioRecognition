# SimpleAudioRecognition

This is a repository for University of Toronto Course ECE 532 Digital System Design ([An old course link here](http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~pc/courses/532/2007/)). Official name of the project is `A Wirelessly Controlled Home Automation System`. It is a system built on [Nexys Video Board](https://store.digilentinc.com/nexys-video-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-for-multimedia-applications/). This system runs a primitive audio recognition system and controls various [PMODs supplied by Digilent](https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-modules/).
